Create one horizontal animation strip for Codex pet `xiao-jiao-long`, state `waving`.

Use the attached canonical base for identity. Use the attached layout guide only for slot count, spacing, centering, and padding; do not draw the guide.

Output exactly 4 full-body frames in one left-to-right row on flat pure green #00FF00. Treat the row as 4 invisible equal-width slots: one centered complete pose per slot, evenly spaced, with no overlap, clipping, empty slots, labels, or borders.

Identity: same pet in every frame: 可爱幼龙，全身紧凑，黑曜石般深黑鳞片，金棕色弯角和腹部鳞甲，琥珀金大眼，小蝠翼，圆润爪子，友好开心表情，保持参考图的手绘贴纸感和粗线条。. Preserve silhouette, face, proportions, markings, palette, material, style, and props.
Style: Pet-safe sprite: compact full-body mascot, readable in a 192x208 cell, clear silhouette, simple face, stable palette/materials, and crisp edges for chroma-key extraction. Style `auto`: Infer the most appropriate pet-safe style from the user request and reference images, then keep that exact style consistent across every row. User style notes: 保持原图的高质量手绘奇幻贴纸风格；在 192x208 单元格内优先可读轮廓和清晰大形，不加入文字、场景、阴影或漂浮特效。.
Animation continuity: keep apparent pet scale and baseline stable within the row unless the state itself intentionally changes vertical position, such as `jumping`. Move the pose within the slot instead of redrawing the pet larger or smaller frame to frame.

State action: Greeting loop: paw or limb down, raised, tilted, and returning in a friendly attention gesture.

State requirements:
- Show the greeting through paw, hand, wing, or limb pose only.
- Do not draw wave marks, motion arcs, lines, sparkles, symbols, or floating effects around the gesture.

Clean extraction: crisp opaque edges, safe padding, no scenery, text, guide marks, checkerboard, shadows, glows, motion blur, speed lines, dust, detached effects, stray pixels, or chroma-key colors inside the pet.
